## Personal Opinions
The table below outlines some personal opinions on the overall offering of the tools.

| Personal Opinion | ECS | Kubernetes | Tutum | Rancher | Kontena | Mesosphere | Shipyard | vamp | lattice | helios | deis | Swarm |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Provides isolation](#provides-isolation) | [N](#ecs-isolation) | Y | Y | Y | | Y | | | | | |

### Provides isolation
Isolation in this context is the ability for a developer to deploy a service onto a running cluster without having to worry about the underlying hardware.
Some of these tools come close but a Yes is defined as a 99-100% isolation from the underlying hardware.
#### ECS Isolation
ECS does not isolate deployments as you need to create ELBs when you want a load balanced service.

## Notes
## EC2 Container Service (ECS)
#### ECS Service Discovery by DNS
I really want to mark this as no but it does support it. You have to create an internal ELB and a Route 53 entry for your service.
It is by no means easy and in my opinion forces Developers to delve into the hardware which takes away isolation of architecture layers.
#### ECS Service Discovery of External Services
Can be done by creating a Route 53 entity.
#### ECS Autoscaling
I think this can be done if you set up Cloudwatch.
#### ECS Private Registry Support
Have to add credentials to all hardware hosts before system start. Really clumsy (changing whilst running would suck).
#### ECS Health Checks
It will check if the container has stopped. Pretty sure thats it. Unless its behind a ELB.
#### ECS API
There is an API but this does not include most of the functions required to actually use ECS.
We have written about ~200+ lines of Bash in order to manage the cluster.

## Kubernetes
#### K8S Service Discovery of External Services
You can create 'services' which map to static IPs but you cannot currently create a 'CNAME' for a service. This is unsuiltable for something that may change IP, like RDS.
#### K8S Autoscaling
This is currently in Beta
#### K8S Private Registry Support
Done using *secrets* on each service you define. Kinda clumsy.
#### K8S Multi-tenancy
Using Namespaces.
#### K8S Public Load Balancers
Kubernetes can create ELBs for specific services.
#### K8S UI
It shows minimal state but does not provide any control.

## Tutum
#### Tutum Local Deployments
As far as I can tell, Tutum is a BYOH (bring your own hardware) so local deployments are possible because Tutum is a hosted API and your hardware 'dials in'.

## vamp
#### vamp Swarm Support
Planned.
