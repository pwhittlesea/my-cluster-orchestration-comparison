## Notes
## Kubernetes
#### K8S Service Discovery of External Services
You can create 'services' which map to static IPs but you cannot currently create a 'CNAME' for a service. This is unsuiltable for something that may change IP, like RDS.
#### K8S Autoscaling
This is currently in Beta
#### K8S Private Registry Support
Done using *secrets* on each service you define. Kinda clumsy.
#### K8S Multiple Clusters
Using Namespaces

## Tutum
#### Tutum Local Deployments
As far as I can tell, Tutum is a BYOH (bring your own hardware) so local deployments are possible because Tutum is a hosted API and your hardware 'dials in'.
